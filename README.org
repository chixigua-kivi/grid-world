* Gym Grid World

This project was separated from @qqiang00 project [[https://github.com/qqiang00/reinforce][reinforce]]. Separation is to facilitate the direct use of this environment in Gym. Of course, I also did a little bit of api adaptation. Thanks again to @qqiang00.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC
pip install -e grid-world
#+END_SRC

Then in your python project:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import gym
import grid_world

env = gym.make('movan-world-v0')
#+END_SRC

* Sample

#+BEGIN_CENTER
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[file:./sample/single-agent.webm]]
#+END_CENTER

- Multi Agent Environment

#+BEGIN_CENTER
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
